    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hey, I'm <strong>Deepu</strong>. Welcome to my corner of the internet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This blog is where I share tech insights, experiments, and learnings. 
      I write about what I'm building, what I'm learning, and occasionally, 
      what I got wrong.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What I Write About</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI & Development</strong> - Working with AI agents, workflows, and tools</li>
      <li><strong>TypeScript & React</strong> - Frontend architecture and patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong> - Backend, automation, and scripts</li>
      <li><strong>Productivity</strong> - Tools and systems that actually work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    
    <p>
      I try to keep things direct and no-bs. If I don't know something, I'll say so. 
      If I got something wrong, I'll update the post. Most things worth writing about 
      have nuance and trade-offs—I try to acknowledge both.
    </p>
