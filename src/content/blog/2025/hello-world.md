# Hello World

This is the first post on DeeBlog. 

I'm keeping this short because there's not much to say yet. The blog is live, the infrastructure works, and now it's time to actually write something useful.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **AI & Development** - Working with AI agents, what actually works vs what's hype
- **TypeScript & React** - Frontend patterns, architecture decisions, trade-offs
- **Python** - Backend stuff, automation, scripts that make life easier
- **Random learnings** - Things I figured out that might help others

## The Philosophy

I'm going to try to keep things direct. No corporate speak, no unnecessary hedging, no "In this blog post, I will discuss..." throat-clearing.

If I'm wrong about something, I'll update the post. If something is uncertain, I'll say so. Most things have trade-offs—I'll try to acknowledge them.

## What's Next

I have a few posts in the drafts folder. They'll show up here when they're ready.

In the meantime, feel free to poke around. The [about page](/about) has more context.

Let's see where this goes.
